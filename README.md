This application developed during a hackathon in 36 hours. It uses [Ionic framework](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic) for app backend and [phaser.js](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) as game engine. This app used as MVP and it is no longer developing. [A new application](https://github.com/otsimo/child) is developing now and it will be open sourced when it is ready.
